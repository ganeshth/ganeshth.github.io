## Welcome to my GitHub Page

This page might be boring, if you have visited other GitHub profiles. I tried to include some of the projects which I worked on, this includes the very first project which was automating the server restarts of around 8 server at the same time. Though it sounds simple, trust me that project saved my weekend 4hours of work. It is not only just restarts, the services present on the servers are to be carefully turned off without causing them to start immediately after restart. I will leave the story for the repo read me page. [Link to be added]

There are other time saving projects and I am not really sure as to how to produce them. I will try and include if possible. 

The next project would be the Distributed Systems Monitor. Right now, it is a private repository and Work in progress (again, frankly I never started it :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: ). There is an existing work of mine which I'm planning to enhance. Hope it works! The idea is to have a centralised setup which fetches the CPU, RAM and Storage space of multiple system and presents it in a well defined fashion. 

This one is a project which everyone commented as impossible. It is a JIRA project and I felt proud after finishing it. [Link to be added]

Frankly speaking, I love open source. Imagine the world if none shared the code they developed. it would be quite different. It is not only about code, it is also about the work like art, books and knowledge. Ones knowledge saves someone's time. They don't have to reinvent the wheel.

This is just a presentation of things. Check my Profile [*ganeshth* on GitHub](https://github.com/ganeshth) :smile:

Hold on! There is also a quote before you step away :grin:
